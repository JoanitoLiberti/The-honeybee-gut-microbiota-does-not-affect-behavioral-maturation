# Gut microbiota and honeybee behavioral maturation
Data and code underlying the study "The honeybee gut microbiota affects the onset of foraging but not the division of labor or associated physiological hallmarks"

We used a combination of automated behavioural tracking, CHC profiling, RNA-sequencing and measurements of weight, hypopharyngeal gland size to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiota and honeybee behavioral maturation. <br />

In the present repository we provide all data, metadata and codes needed to reproduce the analyses. 

Separate folders contain data, metadata and codes for each component of the study: automated behavioral tracking, CHC profiling, RNA-sequencing, weight and hypopharyngeal gland size measurments, as well as comparisons of physiology and behavior between CHC-classified nurses and foragers.
