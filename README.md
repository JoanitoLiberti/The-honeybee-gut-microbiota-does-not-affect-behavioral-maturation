# Investigating the relationship between gut microbiota, behavioral maturation, and division of labor in honeybees
Data and code underlying the study "Gut microbiota influences onset of foraging-related behavior but not physiological hallmarks of division of labor in honeybees".

We used a combination of automated behavioural tracking, CHC profiling, RNA-sequencing and measurements of weight, hypopharyngeal gland size to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiota, behavioral maturation, and the resulting division of labor in honeybee colonies. <br />

In the present repository we provide all data, metadata and codes required to reproduce the analyses. 

Separate folders contain data, metadata and codes for each component of the study: automated behavioral tracking, CHC profiling, RNA-sequencing, weight and hypopharyngeal gland size measurments, as well as comparisons of physiology and behavior between CHC-classified nurses and foragers.
