## The current folder contains the scripts used in the comparisons of behavior and physiology between CHC-classified nurses and foragers, in the automated behavioral tracking and RNA-sequencing experiments, respectively. 

These scripts use some of the input files contained in the other folders. Additional input files should be downloaded from a previously published study and can be found at https://github.com/JoanitoLiberti/The-gut-microbiota-affects-the-social-network-of-honeybees/. The exact files and their download locations are specified within the scripts. 

Set paths within analyses scripts to match the location of the downloaded files on your local drive.
