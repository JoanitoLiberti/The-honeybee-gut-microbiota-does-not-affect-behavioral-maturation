## The current folder contains the scripts used in the analyses of weight in both the RNA-sequencing and the longitudinal weight gain experiments.

The folder contains the data tables and metadata files required to reproduce the analyses for each experiment, as well as a table with raw absolute weights for the longitudinal weight gain experiments.

Set paths within analyses scripts to match the location of the downloaded files on your local drive.
