## The current folder contains the codes used to analyze gene expression in the gut and brain of gnotobiotic honeybees and compare the effects of the gut microbiota to gene expression differences between CHC-classified nurses and foragers. 

Scripts are presented as separate R markdown files for the gut and the brain. 
The folder also contains the data tables and metadata files required to reproduce the analyses.
