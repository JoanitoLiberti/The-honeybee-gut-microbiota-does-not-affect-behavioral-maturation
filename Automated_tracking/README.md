## The current folder contains the scripts used in the analyses of foraging behavior under the automated behavioral tracking systems.

The R code "ForagingCalculations.R" uses the published data from the automated behavioral tracking experiment as input and produces a data table containing foraging behavioral metrics for individual bees: "AllForagingData.csv". This table is then used as input by the "PlotsAndStats_Foraging.Rmd" script for plotting and statistical analyses. Additional input files required to reproduce the analyses should be downloaded from Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5797980 and from our previous repository https://github.com/JoanitoLiberti/The-gut-microbiota-affects-the-social-network-of-honeybees/tree/master/Automated_behavioral_tracking

Set paths within analysis scripts to match the location of the downloaded files on your local drive.
